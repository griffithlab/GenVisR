\description{
Given a data frame construct a plot displaying mutations on a transcript
framework.
}
\details{
lolliplot is a function designed to display mutation information in
the context of a protien identified by an ensembl transcript id. The
lolliplot function will query ensembl via biomart to retrieve sequence and
domain information in order to construct a representation of a protein and
therefore requires an internet connection. A value must be supplied to the
species parameter (defaults to hsapiens) in order for a successful biomart
query. Valid arguments to this field are those species with datasts available
via ensembl. please specify species in lowercase without a period
(i.e. hsapiens instead of H.sapiens), lolliplot will inform the user of
available species if input to the species parameter is not recognized.
Further lolliplot will build a protein framework based on sequence data
obtained from biomaRt, by default this will default to the latest ensembl
version. In order for the most accurate representation the annotation version
of the mutations given to lolliplot should match the annotation version used 
by biomaRt. The annotation version used by biomaRt can be changed via the 
host paramter (see vignette for more details).

lolliplot is capable of plotting two seperate sets of data on the protein
representation specified by parameters `x` and `y`, the data supplied to
these parameters will be plotted on the top and bottom of the protein
respectively. Note that input to these parameters is expected to correspond
to a single ensembl transcript and that values in the "amino_acid_change"
columns are required to be in p. notation (i.e. p.V600E). Further lolliplot
is able to plot custom domain annotation if supplied via the parameter `z`,
this will override domain information obtained from biomart.

lolliplot uses a forcefield model from the package FField to attract and 
repulse lollis. The parameters for this force field model are set to
reasonable defaults however may be adjusted via the obsA... and obsB...
family of parameters. Please see the package FField available on cran for
a description of these parameters. Note that the time to construct the
lolliplot will in large part depend on the number of mutations and the values
supplied to the forcefield parameters.
